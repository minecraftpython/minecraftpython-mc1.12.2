# minecraftpython
minecraftpython ('Minecraft Python Programming' if you insist) is a mod for Minecraft that provides a Python API allowing users to customize their Minecraft worlds in real time while playing using Python code they've written.

This repository is intended for those who are curious about the source code for the mod.  If you're looking to use the mod at home on your computer, you don't need this source code - just a working copy of Minecraft Forge and the mod's .jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/minecraftpython/minecraftpython-mc1.12.2/releases) page.
